3.Heat over medium high to high heat. You want the pan to be as hot as you can get it without burning the butter. Allow butter to melt, swirling frequently to prevent burning. The more you move the butter around, the less it will burn.</td>

    <td>2 tablespoons butter Kerrygold recommended</td>

Sear 2-3 minutes on both sides, constantly spooning the hot butter onto the steaks, and only turn once after they get nicely browned. Do not let the butter burn - keep it moving. Insert thermometer into thickest part of steak and transfer pan with steaks to hot oven.
